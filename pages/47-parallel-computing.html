<h2>4.7   Parallel Computing</h2>
<p>From the 1970s through the mid-2000s, the speed of individual processor cores
grew at an exponential rate. Much of this increase in speed was accomplished by
increasing the <em>clock frequency</em>, the rate at which a processor performs basic
operations. In the mid-2000s, however, this exponential increase came to an
abrupt end, due to power and thermal constraints, and the speed of individual
processor cores has increased much more slowly since then. Instead, CPU
manufacturers began to place multiple cores in a single processor, enabling more
operations to be performed concurrently.</p>
<p>Parallelism is not a new concept. Large-scale parallel machines have been used
for decades, primarily for scientific computing and data analysis. Even in
personal computers with a single processor core, operating systems and
interpreters have provided the abstraction of concurrency. This is done through
<em>context switching</em>, or rapidly switching between different tasks without
waiting for them to complete. Thus, multiple programs can run on the same
machine concurrently, even if it only has a single processing core.</p>
<p>Given the current trend of increasing the number of processor cores, individual
applications must now take advantage of parallelism in order to run faster.
Within a single program, computation must be arranged so that as much work can
be done in parallel as possible. However, parallelism introduces new challenges
in writing correct code, particularly in the presence of shared, mutable state.</p>
<p>For problems that can be solved efficiently in the functional model, with no
shared mutable state, parallelism poses few problems. Pure functions provide
<em>referential transparency</em>, meaning that expressions can be replaced with their
values, and vice versa, without affecting the behavior of a program. This
enables expressions that do not depend on each other to be evaluated in
parallel. As discussed in the previous section, the MapReduce framework allows
functional programs to be specified and run in parallel with minimal programmer
effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all problems can be solved efficiently using functional
programming. The Berkeley View project has identified <a class="reference external" href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Dwarf_Mine">thirteen common
computational patterns</a> in
science and engineering, only one of which is MapReduce. The remaining patterns
require shared state.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, we will see how mutable shared state can
introduce bugs into parallel programs and a number of approaches to prevent such
bugs. We will examine these techniques in the context of two applications, a
web <a class="reference external" href="../examples/parallel/crawler.py.html">crawler</a> and a particle <a class="reference external" href="../examples/parallel/particle.py.html">simulator</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="parallelism-in-python">
<h3>4.7.1   Parallelism in Python</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into the details of parallelism, let us first explore
Python's support for parallel computation. Python provides two means of
parallel execution: threading and multiprocessing.</p>
<p><strong>Threading</strong>. In <em>threading</em>, multiple "threads" of execution exist within a
single interpreter. Each thread executes code independently from the others,
though they share the same data. However, the CPython interpreter, the main
implementation of Python, only interprets code in one thread at a time,
switching between them in order to provide the illusion of parallelism. On
the other hand, operations external to the interpreter, such as writing to a
file or accessing the network, may run in parallel.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">threading</tt> module contains classes that enable threads to be created
and synchronized. The following is a simple example of a multithreaded program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">threading</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">thread_hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="n">other</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">threading</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Thread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">thread_say_hello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="n">thread_say_hello</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">thread_say_hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'hello from'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threading</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">current_thread</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">thread_hello</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">hello from Thread-1</span>
<span class="go">hello from MainThread</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Thread</tt> constructor creates a new thread. It requires a target function
that the new thread should run, as well as the arguments to that function.
Calling <tt class="docutils literal">start</tt> on a <tt class="docutils literal">Thread</tt> object marks it ready to run. The
<tt class="docutils literal">current_thread</tt> function returns the <tt class="docutils literal">Thread</tt> object associated with the
current thread of execution.</p>
<p>In this example, the prints can happen in any order, since we haven't
synchronized them in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Multiprocessing</strong>. Python also supports <em>multiprocessing</em>, which allows a
program to spawn multiple interpreters, or <em>processes</em>, each of which can run
code independently. These processes do not generally share data, so any shared
state must be communicated between processes. On the other hand, processes
execute in parallel according to the level of parallelism provided by the
underlying operating system and hardware. Thus, if the CPU has multiple
processor cores, Python processes can truly run concurrently.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">multiprocessing</tt> module contains classes for creating and synchronizing
processes. The following is the hello example using processes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">multiprocessing</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process_hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="n">other</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">multiprocessing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">process_say_hello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="n">process_say_hello</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process_say_hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="gp">    </span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'hello from'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">multiprocessing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">current_process</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">process_hello</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">hello from MainProcess</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hello</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">Process</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As this example demonstrates, many of the classes and functions in
<tt class="docutils literal">multiprocessing</tt> are analogous to those in <tt class="docutils literal">threading</tt>. This example also
demonstrates how lack of synchronization affects shared state, as the display
can be considered shared state. Here, the interpreter prompt from the
interactive process appears before the print output from the other process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-problem-with-shared-state">
<h3>4.7.2   The Problem with Shared State</h3>
<p>To further illustrate the problem with shared state, let's look at a simple
example of a counter that is shared between two threads:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import threading
from time import sleep

counter = [0]

def increment():
    count = counter[0]
    sleep(0) # try to force a switch to the other thread
    counter[0] = count + 1

other = threading.Thread(target=increment, args=())
other.start()
increment()
print('count is now: ', counter[0])
</pre>
<p>In this program, two threads attempt to increment the same counter. The CPython
interpreter can switch between threads at almost any time. Only the most basic
operations are <em>atomic</em>, meaning that they appear to occur instantly, with no
switch possible during their evaluation or execution. Incrementing a counter
requires multiple basic operations: read the old value, add one to it, and write
the new value. The interpreter can switch threads between any of these
operations.</p>
<p>In order to show what happens when the interpreter switches threads at the wrong
time, we have attempted to force a switch by sleeping for 0 seconds. When this
code is run, the interpreter often does switch threads at the <tt class="docutils literal">sleep</tt> call.
This can result in the following sequence of operations:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Thread 0                    Thread 1
read counter[0]: 0
                            read counter[0]: 0
calculate 0 + 1: 1
write 1 -&gt; counter[0]
                            calculate 0 + 1: 1
                            write 1 -&gt; counter[0]
</pre>
<p>The end result is that the counter has a value of 1, even though it was
incremented twice! Worse, the interpreter may only switch at the wrong time very
rarely, making this difficult to debug. Even with the <tt class="docutils literal">sleep</tt> call, this
program sometimes produces a correct count of 2 and sometimes an incorrect count
of 1.</p>
<p>This problem arises only in the presence of shared data that may be mutated by
one thread while another thread accesses it. Such a conflict is called a <em>race
condition</em>, and it is an example of a bug that only exists in the parallel
world.</p>
<p>In order to avoid race conditions, shared data that may be mutated and accessed
by multiple threads must be protected against concurrent access. For example, if
we can ensure that thread 1 only accesses the counter after thread 0 finishes
accessing it, or vice versa, we can guarantee that the right result is computed.
We say that shared data is <em>synchronized</em> if it is protected from concurrent
access. In the next few subsections, we will see multiple mechanisms providing
synchronization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-no-synchronization-is-necessary">
<h3>4.7.3   When No Synchronization is Necessary</h3>
<p>In some cases, access to shared data need not be synchronized, if concurrent
access cannot result in incorrect behavior. The simplest example is read-only
data. Since such data is never mutated, all threads will always read the same
values regardless when they access the data.</p>
<p>In rare cases, shared data that is mutated may not require synchronization.
However, understanding when this is the case requires a deep knowledge of how
the interpreter and underlying software and hardware work. Consider the
following example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
items = []
flag = []

def consume():
    while not flag:
        pass
    print('items is', items)

def produce():
    consumer = threading.Thread(target=consume, args=())
    consumer.start()
    for i in range(10):
        items.append(i)
    flag.append('go')

produce()
</pre>
<p>Here, the producer thread adds items to <tt class="docutils literal">items</tt>, while the consumer waits
until <tt class="docutils literal">flag</tt> is non-empty. When the producer finishes adding items, it adds an
element to <tt class="docutils literal">flag</tt>, allowing the consumer to proceed.</p>
<p>In most Python implementations, this example will work correctly. However, a
common optimization in other compilers and interpreters, and even the hardware
itself, is to reorder operations within a single thread that do not depend on
each other for data. In such a system, the statement <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flag.append('go')</span></tt> may
be moved before the loop, since neither depends on the other for data. In
general, you should avoid code like this unless you are certain that the
underlying system won't reorder the relevant operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="synchronized-data-structures">
<h3>4.7.4   Synchronized Data Structures</h3>
<p>The simplest means of synchronizing shared data is to use a data structure
that provides synchronized operations. The <tt class="docutils literal">queue</tt> module contains a
<tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt> class that provides synchronized first in, first out access to
data. The <tt class="docutils literal">put</tt> method adds an item to the <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt>, and the <tt class="docutils literal">get</tt>
method retrieves an item. The class itself ensures that these methods are
synchronized, so items are not lost no matter how thread operations are
interleaved. Here is a producer/consumer example that uses a <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from queue import Queue

queue = Queue()

def synchronized_consume():
    while True:
        print('got an item:', queue.get())
        queue.task_done()

def synchronized_produce():
    consumer = threading.Thread(target=synchronized_consume, args=())
    consumer.daemon = True
    consumer.start()
    for i in range(10):
        queue.put(i)
    queue.join()

synchronized_produce()
</pre>
<p>There are a few changes to this code, in addition to the <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">get</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">put</tt> calls. We have marked the consumer thread as a <em>daemon</em>, which means
that the program will not wait for that thread to complete before exiting. This
allows us to use an infinite loop in the consumer. However, we do need to ensure
that the main thread exits, but only after all items have been consumed from the
<tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt>. The consumer calls the <tt class="docutils literal">task_done</tt> method to inform the <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt>
that it is done processing an item, and the main thread calls the <tt class="docutils literal">join</tt>
method, which waits until all items have been processed, ensuring that the
program exits only after that is the case.</p>
<p>A more complex example that makes use of a <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt> is a parallel web
<a class="reference external" href="../examples/parallel/crawler.py.html">crawler</a> that searches for dead links on a website. This crawler follows all
links that are hosted by the same site, so it must process a number of URLs,
continually adding new ones to a <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt> and removing URLs for processing.
By using a synchronized <tt class="docutils literal">Queue</tt>, multiple threads can safely add to and
remove from the data structure concurrently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="locks">
<h3>4.7.5   Locks</h3>
<p>When a synchronized version of a particular data structure is not available, we
have to provide our own synchronization. A <em>lock</em> is a basic mechanism to do so.
It can be <em>acquired</em> by at most one thread, after which no other thread may
acquire it until it is <em>released</em> by the thread that previously acquired it.</p>
<p>In Python, the <tt class="docutils literal">threading</tt> module contains a <tt class="docutils literal">Lock</tt> class to provide
locking. A <tt class="docutils literal">Lock</tt> has <tt class="docutils literal">acquire</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">release</tt> methods to acquire and
release the lock, and the class guarantees that only one thread at a time can
acquire it. All other threads that attempt to acquire a lock while it is already
being held are forced to wait until it is released.</p>
<p>For a lock to protect a particular set of data, all the threads need to be
programmed to follow a rule: no thread will access any of the shared data unless
it owns that particular lock. In effect, all the threads need to "wrap" their
manipulation of the shared data in <tt class="docutils literal">acquire</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">release</tt> calls for that
lock.</p>
<p>In the parallel web <a class="reference external" href="../examples/parallel/crawler.py.html">crawler</a>, a set is used to keep track of all URLs that
have been encountered by any thread, so as to avoid processing a particular URL
more than once (and potentially getting stuck in a cycle). However, Python does
not provide a synchronized set, so we must use a lock to protect access to a
normal set:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
seen = set()
seen_lock = threading.Lock()

def already_seen(item):
    seen_lock.acquire()
    result = True
    if item not in seen:
        seen.add(item)
        result = False
    seen_lock.release()
    return result
</pre>
<p>A lock is necessary here, in order to prevent another thread from adding the URL
to the set between this thread checking if it is in the set and adding it to the
set. Furthermore, adding to a set is not atomic, so concurrent attempts to add
to a set may corrupt its internal data.</p>
<p>In this code, we had to be careful not to return until after we released the
lock. In general, we have to ensure that we release a lock when we no longer
need it. This can be very error-prone, particularly in the presence of
exceptions, so Python provides a <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> compound statement that handles
acquiring and releasing a lock for us:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def already_seen(item):
    with seen_lock:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            return False
        return True
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> statement ensures that <tt class="docutils literal">seen_lock</tt> is acquired before its suite
is executed and that it is released when the suite is exited for any reason.
(The <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> statement can actually be used for operations other than locking,
though we won't cover alternative uses here.)</p>
<p>Operations that must be synchronized with each other must use the same lock.
However, two disjoint sets of operations that must be synchronized only with
operations in the same set should use two different lock objects to avoid
over-synchronization.</p>

<div class="section" id="barriers">
<h3>4.7.6   Barriers</h3>
<p>Another way to avoid conflicting access to shared data is to divide a program
into phases, ensuring that shared data is mutated in a phase in which no other
thread accesses it. A <em>barrier</em> divides a program into phases by requiring
all threads to reach it before any of them can proceed. Code that is executed
after a barrier cannot be concurrent with code executed before the barrier.</p>
<p>In Python, the <tt class="docutils literal">threading</tt> module provides a barrier in the form of the
the <tt class="docutils literal">wait</tt> method of a <tt class="docutils literal">Barrier</tt> instance:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
counters = [0, 0]
barrier = threading.Barrier(2)

def count(thread_num, steps):
    for i in range(steps):
        other = counters[1 - thread_num]
        barrier.wait() # wait for reads to complete
        counters[thread_num] = other + 1
        barrier.wait() # wait for writes to complete

def threaded_count(steps):
    other = threading.Thread(target=count, args=(1, steps))
    other.start()
    count(0, steps)
    print('counters:', counters)

threaded_count(10)
</pre>
<p>In this example, reading and writing to shared data take place in different
phases, separated by barriers. The writes occur in the same phase, but they are
disjoint; this disjointness is necessary to avoid concurrent writes to the same
data in the same phase. Since this code is properly synchronized, both counters
will always be 10 at the end.</p>
<p>The multithreaded particle <a class="reference external" href="../examples/parallel/particle.py.html">simulator</a> uses a barrier in a similar fashion to
synchronize access to shared data. In the simulation, each thread owns a number
of particles, all of which interact with each other over the course of many
discrete timesteps. A particle has a position, velocity, and acceleration, and a
new acceleration is computed in each timestep based on the positions of the
other particles. The velocity of the particle must be updated accordingly, and
its position according to its velocity.</p>
<p>As with the simple example above, there is a read phase, in which all particles'
positions are read by all threads. Each thread updates its own particles'
acceleration in this phase, but since these are disjoint writes, they need not
be synchronized. In the write phase, each thread updates its own particles'
velocities and positions. Again, these are disjoint writes, and they are
protected from the read phase by barriers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="message-passing">
<h3>4.7.7   Message Passing</h3>
<p>A final mechanism to avoid improper mutation of shared data is to entirely avoid
concurrent access to the same data. In Python, using multiprocessing rather than
threading naturally results in this, since processes run in separate
interpreters with their own data. Any state required by multiple processes can
be communicated by passing messages between processes.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Pipe</tt> class in the <tt class="docutils literal">multiprocessing</tt> module provides a communication
channel between processes. By default, it is duplex, meaning a two-way channel,
though passing in the argument <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt> results in a one-way channel. The
<tt class="docutils literal">send</tt> method sends an object over the channel, while the <tt class="docutils literal">recv</tt> method
receives an object. The latter is <em>blocking</em>, meaning that a process that calls
<tt class="docutils literal">recv</tt> will wait until an object is received.</p>
<p>The following is a producer/consumer example using processes and pipes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def process_consume(in_pipe):
    while True:
        item = in_pipe.recv()
        if item is None:
            return
        print('got an item:', item)

def process_produce():
    pipe = multiprocessing.Pipe(False)
    consumer = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_consume, args=(pipe[0],))
    consumer.start()
    for i in range(10):
        pipe[1].send(i)
    pipe[1].send(None) # done signal

process_produce()
</pre>
<p>In this example, we use a <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> message to signal the end of communication.
We also passed in one end of the pipe as an argument to the target function when
creating the consumer process. This is necessary, since state must be explicitly
shared between processes.</p>
<p>The multiprocess version of the particle <a class="reference external" href="../examples/parallel/particle.py.html">simulator</a> uses pipes to communicate
particle positions between processes in each timestep. In fact, it uses pipes to
set up an entire circular pipeline between processes, in order to minimize
communication. Each process injects its own particles' positions into its
pipeline stage, which eventually go through a full rotation of the pipeline. At
each step of the rotation, a process applies forces from the positions that are
currently in its own pipeline stage on to its own particles, so that after a
full rotation, all forces have been applied to its particles.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">multiprocessing</tt> module provides other synchronization mechanisms for
processes, including synchronized queues, locks, and as of Python 3.3, barriers.
For example, a lock or a barrier can be used to synchronize printing to the
screen, avoiding the improper display output we saw previously.</p>

<div class="section" id="synchronization-pitfalls">
<h3>4.7.8   Synchronization Pitfalls</h3>
<p>While synchronization methods are effective for protecting shared state, they
can also be used incorrectly, failing to accomplish the proper synchronization,
over-synchronizing, or causing the program to hang as a result of deadlock.</p>
<p><strong>Under-synchronization</strong>. A common pitfall in parallel computing is to neglect
to properly synchronize shared accesses. In the set example, we need to
synchronize the membership check and insertion together, so that another thread
cannot perform an insertion in between these two operations. Failing to
synchronize the two operations together is erroneous, even if they are
separately synchronized.</p>
<p><strong>Over-synchronization</strong>. Another common error is to over-synchronize a program,
so that non-conflicting operations cannot occur concurrently. As a trivial
example, we can avoid all conflicting access to shared data by acquiring a
master lock when a thread starts and only releasing it when a thread completes.
This serializes our entire code, so that nothing runs in parallel. In some
cases, this can even cause our program to hang indefinitely. For example,
consider a consumer/producer program in which the consumer obtains the lock and
never releases it. This prevents the producer from producing any items, which in
turn prevents the consumer from doing anything since it has nothing to consume.</p>
<p>While this example is trivial, in practice, programmers often over-synchronize
their code to some degree, preventing their code from taking complete advantage
of the available parallelism.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlock</strong>. Because they cause threads or processes to wait on each other,
synchronization mechanisms are vulnerable to <em>deadlock</em>, a situation in which
two or more threads or processes are stuck, waiting for each other to finish. We
have just seen how neglecting to release a lock can cause a thread to get stuck
indefinitely. But even if threads or processes do properly release locks,
programs can still reach deadlock.</p>
<p>The source of deadlock is a <em>circular wait</em>, illustrated below with processes.
No process can continue because it is waiting for other processes that are
waiting for it to complete.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="../img/deadlock.png"/>
</div>
<p>As an example, we will set up a deadlock with two processes. Suppose they share
a duplex pipe and attempt to communicate with each other as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def deadlock(in_pipe, out_pipe):
    item = in_pipe.recv()
    print('got an item:', item)
    out_pipe.send(item + 1)

def create_deadlock():
    pipe = multiprocessing.Pipe()
    other = multiprocessing.Process(target=deadlock, args=(pipe[0], pipe[1]))
    other.start()
    deadlock(pipe[1], pipe[0])

create_deadlock()
</pre>
<p>Both processes attempt to receive data first. Recall that the <tt class="docutils literal">recv</tt> method
blocks until an item is available. Since neither process has sent anything, both
will wait indefinitely for the other to send it data, resulting in deadlock.</p>
<p>Synchronization operations must be properly aligned to avoid deadlock. This may
require sending over a pipe before receiving, acquiring multiple locks in the
same order, and ensuring that all threads reach the right barrier at the right
time.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h3>4.7.9   Conclusion</h3>
<p>As we have seen, parallelism presents new challenges in writing correct and
efficient code. As the trend of increasing parallelism at the hardware level
will continue for the foreseeable future, parallel computation will become more
and more important in application programming. There is a very active body of
research on making parallelism easier and less error-prone for programmers. Our
discussion here serves only as a basic introduction to this crucial area of
computer science.</p>
